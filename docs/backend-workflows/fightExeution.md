# Fight Execution - Workflow üåäü¶≠üåä

1Ô∏è‚É£ After the matchmaking is done `FightsMatchmaker` calls `FightsExecutor`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ `FightsExecutor` gathers NFTs information from the `NFTContract` or the `NFTBarracks` and calls ChainlinkFunctions with
the default fight prompt.

3Ô∏è‚É£ A `DON` will receive the deno ("javascript") code and execute an API call to OpenAI-ChatPGT to simulate the fight. Two stories will be gaenerated, 1 where one player wins and another where the other player wins.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The `DON` will return the result of the fight to `FightsExecutor`.

5Ô∏è‚É£ The stories generated by ChatGPT will be emitted as an event. `TheGraph` will register them. A hash of them will be stored as their ID. The user will se in the font-end somehting like: Two alternative futures are being decided by quantum fluctuations... In the same transaction a VRF request is sent.

6Ô∏è‚É£ A winner will be generated via VRF. (50% chance of winning so far). (TODO: implement mechanics that dynamically adjust the chance of winning according to NFTs and players)

7Ô∏è‚É£ The winner decided by VRF will receive the bets both players sent and he will be marked as winner of that fight. The front-end will react to the story ID who won and declare show the winner.
