# Fight Automation - Workflow üåäü¶≠üåä

> üìò **Note:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è Recommended to use in `Avalanche` because its cheaper and faster to use.

1Ô∏è‚É£ The `FightsAutomator` contract will use Chainlink Automation to check in every block the `FightsMatchmaker` state.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If there is someone marked as searching for fight in the `FightsMatchmaker` then `FightsExecutor`'s `startFight()` will be called to execute the fight. (via event-log trigger)

3Ô∏è‚É£ When the fight finishes after the VRF call, then if the player still have funds will re-enter the looking for fight state.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Chainlink Automation will keep checking if the automated NFTs are currently fighting and if not it will check to see if there is a fight available for them.

## Drawbacks üò≤

1. To make the app decentralized we need to track the pending fight requests on-chain. That is why we only allowed for 1 NFT to be automated on-chain at the same time. As it would become more expensevie with a greater numbers.

If Chanlink Functions could track previous logs thanks to a library this process wouldn't need to be stored on-chain as matchmaking could be done via logs. Thus making all cheaper.
