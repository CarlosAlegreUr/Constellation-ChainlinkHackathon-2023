# Fight Automation - Workflow üåäü¶≠üåä

> üìò **Note:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è Only available in Avalanche because its cheaper and faster to use.

1Ô∏è‚É£ The `FightsAutomator` contract will use Chainlink Automation to check in every block the `FightsMatchmaker` state.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If there is someone marked as searching for fight in the `FightsMatchmaker` then `FightsAutomator` will call `FightsExecutor` to execute the fight. When the fight finishes in `FightsAutomator` after the VRF call, then `FightsAutomator` will call `FightsExecutor` to put the automated NFT looking for someone to fight again in `FightsMatchmaker`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Chainlink Automation will keep checking if the automated NFTs are in a fight already and if not it will check to see if there is a fight available.
