# Challenge Friends - Workflow 🌊🦭🌊

**_On `Ethereum`:_**

1️⃣ On the front-end, you will interact with `ENS` contracts to resgister a name for you or your NFT.

2️⃣ Then, through the front-end it will be posible for you to just write someone's name and the front-end will execute
the address resolution and call the `requestFight()` function as explained in the [matchmaking workflow](./matchmaking.md).

3️⃣ Notice as you are challenging someone, this time only that person will be able to use `acceptFight()` to execute the fight.
