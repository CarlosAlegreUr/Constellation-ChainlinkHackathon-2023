# Challenge Friends - Workflow üåäü¶≠üåä

**_On `Ethereum`:_**

1Ô∏è‚É£ The `FightsMatchmaker` will call the `ENS-NameResolver` to resolve the name of your friend, or the name of its NFT to the corresponding address.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Then `FightsMatchmaker` will save in the blockchains state that you are proposing your friend a fight and an event will be emitted. TheGraph will see it and your friend will receive a notification on the browser.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Your friend accepts the fight calling `FightsMatchmaker` and it will call `FightsExecutor` and execute the fight logic.

**_On `Other Chains`:_**

1Ô∏è‚É£ As ENS is only availabe in `Ethereum` then a CCIP call will be done to `Ethereum` to resolve the name. Once that finishes the nexts steps are the same.
