### Details 📝

On top of this ontracts we use:

- `TheGraph` to keep track of events and notify users.
- `ENS` for easily challenging friends addresses mapping them to human readable nicknames.

We use `Ethereum` for storing our collection due to its higher decentralization and security. And we leverage `Avalanche` for its chepaer costs when automating game mechanics or in its simple execution. This dual-chain approach benefits players who prefer economical gameplay, while still having their fighter assets on a higher decentralization chain.
