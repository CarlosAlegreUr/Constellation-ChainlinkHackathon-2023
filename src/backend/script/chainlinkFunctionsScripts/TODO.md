## TODO IF WITH TIME ðŸ•¥

- Create new model that won't use chainlink functions and use a MOCKED DON so as to not have the 9s limitation for the
POC.

### Prompt engineering

- Minting Figther:

We need a way to normalize all the responses from chatGPT, if it's invalid to only give us a determined string, ie. "INVALID".
If not, pass a first a string indicating that is valid, ie. "VALID" 

If it's valid we can generate an image for the NFT with openAI
